## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- **Accounting model decision (2026-06-06, human sign-off):** P&L now uses the
  adjusted-cost model — cash dividends fold into cost (no separate dividend-income line),
  realized/unrealized computed vs `adjusted_cost`; `original_cost` retained for the
  return-rate denominator and the capital-gain-vs-dividend split. Supersedes the prior
  original-cost-plus-separate-dividend rule in `domain-ledger.md`. The no-double-count
  principle is preserved (dividends still counted exactly once). Return-rate denominator
  stays original invested cost; cost basis is all-in (incl. buy fees+tax).

### Added
- `shared/` foundation layer: `Currency`/`Market` enums; `Decimal` money primitives
  (canonical TEXT persistence via `to_db`/`from_db`, per-currency `quantize_amount`
  with ROUND_HALF_UP, float + non-finite guards); single pure `fx.convert` helper
  (rejects non-positive / non-finite rates); env-driven `Settings` + cached
  `get_settings`; stdlib `sqlite3` `get_connection`/`session` (WAL, foreign keys on).
- Package + tooling bootstrap: `pyproject.toml` (pydantic, pydantic-settings; dev:
  mypy strict, ruff, pytest, pytest-asyncio; strict `asyncio_mode`); `portfolio_dash/`
  package with `py.typed`; `tests/` layout.
- `portfolio/` calculation core: chronological ledger replay (`build_book`) →
  holdings + realized P&L; `value_holdings` (unrealized vs adjusted, capital-gain vs
  original, stale-price flagging); `total_return` (per-currency + reporting blended);
  reporting-currency `xirr_reporting` (pyxirr); `sector_allocation`; `combined_view`.
- `shared/models/`: canonical domain models (`Account`, `Instrument`, `Transaction`,
  `Dividend`, `FXConversion`, `OpeningInventory`) + `Money` finite-Decimal type.
- Dependency: `pyxirr` (irregular-cashflow XIRR).
- `forex/` FX (換匯) P&L: per-account foreign-currency pool (weighted-avg acquisition
  rate from home→foreign conversions), reconstructed foreign cash balance, realized FX on
  reconversions, unrealized FX (stocks + cash) marked to spot; reporting-currency
  `FXSummary` rollup. Presented as an attribution decomposition of the portfolio return
  (asset + FX), never additive.
- Data-source availability probe (spike) under `scripts/probe/`: typed harness
  (`ProbeResult` model, `run_probe` runner + fixture recorder, markdown report renderer)
  + live adapters (yfinance, TWSE, TPEx, twstock, stockprices.dev, klsescreener; FinMind /
  AlphaVantage / Finnhub keyed). Produced a ranked primary/fallback recommendation per
  (data type × market) and recorded raw fixtures under `tests/pricing/fixtures/` for
  `pricing/` mock tests. Results + `pricing/` architecture recommendation:
  `docs/probes/2026-06-08-data-source-probe-results.md`. Key findings: yfinance is the
  US/MY/FX workhorse primary; TW latest quotes from TWSE/TPEx string sources for true tick
  precision; MY 3-dp verified via klsescreener (yfinance is float64 — convert via
  `Decimal(str(...))`); TW board (上市/上櫃) must be resolved per instrument; keyed sources
  (FinMind/AlphaVantage/Finnhub) and Schwab await keys/OAuth.
- FinMind **validated** (2026-06-08, trial token, 600/hr): 6 datasets confirmed (price,
  dividend/除權息, FX, financial statements, institutional, margin) with fixtures under
  `tests/pricing/fixtures/finmind/`. Added capability research notes under `docs/research/`
  for **Schwab Trader API** (enables US account/transaction auto-import for `data_ingestion/`)
  and **FinMind** — both feeding `pricing/` source selection, `llm_insight/` fundamentals, and
  the LLM self-backtest loop.

### Planned
- `llm_insight/` prediction self-tracking + backtest loop (future sub-project): the LLM
  records each recommendation/forecast, later replays and scores its own past predictions
  against realized outcomes, accumulating a per-prediction confidence index and a
  corrective feedback loop that informs future advice. Gets its own brainstorm at the
  `llm_insight/` stage.
- `llm_insight/` insight inputs & per-stock prompt (future): per-holding decision signals from
  FinMind (財報 / 月營收 / 法人 / 融資券 / PER-PBR / news URL) plus **US sentiment indicators —
  CNN Fear & Greed Index and VIX** — as buy/sell context. **Prompt architecture (decided
  2026-06-08):** one editable **default system prompt** (ships as a Claude-recommended best prompt; user
  fine-tunes in config) holds the output contract + invariants (JSON schema, no
  numbers-of-record, batch-only) and is immutable by overrides; reusable, named
  **Strategy Prompts** add a per-type analytical focus, and each stock's Strategy is **blank by
  default**, optionally **selecting 0..1** from the library (per-stock assignment — option A; data model pre-reserves tag/category binding for a
  later upgrade). All prompts live in the settings (config) page, versioned and folded into the
  cache fingerprint + self-backtest attribution (per `llm-insight.md`).
- **User authentication / access control** (`web_ui/`, future): basic login + permission gating
  so the self-hosted instance (1–2 users) is not publicly exposed on the network — kept minimal.

## [v0.0.0] - 2026-06-05

### Added
- Project bootstrap: `CLAUDE.md`; `.claude/rules/` (stack, architecture,
  domain-ledger, markets-and-fees, data-and-pricing, llm-insight, engineering-process,
  design-handoff); `.claude/skills/` (resume-dev, ship-version); README, this
  changelog, LESSONS_LEARNED, .gitignore.
- Locked technology selection (Python 3.12 monolith: FastAPI + Jinja2 + HTMX +
  Alpine + ECharts + SQLite + LiteLLM + APScheduler; mypy strict; pytest).
- Domain model: `account` as a first-class entity (TW broker · Charles Schwab US ·
  Moomoo MY US · Moomoo MY); three markets (TW / US / MY); multi-currency
  (TWD / USD / MYR) with a single-reporting-currency combined XIRR (trade-date FX)
  and a currency-exchange ledger.
- Numeric precision model: `Decimal` end to end; store at full source precision
  (MY prices up to 3 dp), quantize amounts per currency minor unit at settlement.
