## [Unreleased]

### Planned
- `portfolio/` cost-basis & return core (weighted-average cost, original vs adjusted,
  realized / unrealized P&L, total return without double-counting dividends, XIRR).
- `forex/` currency-exchange ledger + realized/unrealized FX P&L (attribution).
- Data-source availability probe: US / TW / MY quotes; USD/TWD, USD/MYR, MYR/TWD FX;
  ex-dividend calendar.

## [v0.0.0] - 2026-06-05

### Added
- Project bootstrap: `CLAUDE.md`; `.claude/rules/` (stack, architecture,
  domain-ledger, markets-and-fees, data-and-pricing, llm-insight, engineering-process,
  design-handoff); `.claude/skills/` (resume-dev, ship-version); README, this
  changelog, LESSONS_LEARNED, .gitignore.
- Locked technology selection (Python 3.12 monolith: FastAPI + Jinja2 + HTMX +
  Alpine + ECharts + SQLite + LiteLLM + APScheduler; mypy strict; pytest).
- Domain model: `account` as a first-class entity (TW broker · Charles Schwab US ·
  Moomoo MY US · Moomoo MY); three markets (TW / US / MY); multi-currency
  (TWD / USD / MYR) with a single-reporting-currency combined XIRR (trade-date FX)
  and a currency-exchange ledger.
- Numeric precision model: `Decimal` end to end; store at full source precision
  (MY prices up to 3 dp), quantize amounts per currency minor unit at settlement.
